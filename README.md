# data-wrangling-final-project

RNR437 final project repository

This repository will be for cleaning VGS production data.

The dataset is from the SRER. I will be focusing on the 2024 dry weight rank data. This rapid assessment tool ranks the top 3 species in a quadrat. Using this allows us to get a basic idea of the dominant vegetation in each transect.

Structure:

data_clean contains clean datasets with relevant columns only

data_raw contains the .xlsx file downloaded directly from the VGS website

plots contain averages of vegetation composition

scripts contain R scripts of code that accomplishes the goals of the project

documents contains all markdown and .qmd files
